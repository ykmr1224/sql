# This workflow has been consolidated into test-reports-generator.yml
# The combined workflow provides better reliability and artifact sharing
# between the report generation and publishing jobs.
#
# To use the HTML reports publishing feature:
# 1. Run the "Generate Test Reports and Publish" workflow
# 2. It will automatically generate reports and publish them to GitHub Pages
# 3. The published reports will be available at:
#    https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/revision-<commit-sha>/
#
# This file is kept for reference but is no longer used.
